# First capstone project(Financial Calculators) - Python
This is my first capstone project from Python learning.

Task 5 - Capstone Project - Variables and Control Structures

Description of the task:
For this task, assume that you have been approached by a small financial
company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access two
different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan
repayment calculator.

The user will simply choose to use either one of the calculator and then will be asked to input the value for the calculation.

# Investment Calculator
The user will be asked to input the followings:
- The amount of money that they are depositing.
- The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest
rate should be entered — don’t worry about having to deal with the
added ‘%’, e.g. The user should enter 8 and not 8%.
- The number of years they plan on investing.
- Then ask the user to input if they want “simple” or “compound”
interest, and store this in a variable called interest. Depending on
whether or not they typed “simple” or “compound”, output the
appropriate amount that they will get back after the given period,
at the specified interest rate.

# Bond Calculator
The user will be asked to input the followings:
- The present value of the house. e.g. 100000
- The interest rate. e.g. 7
- The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond. e.g. 120
