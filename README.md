Positive

Great stuff, Jonathan, keep up the good work! You have met the requirements of the task. Good job!



Improve

Instead of having multiple print statements to print the output when the program starts. The use of multiline output when printing can be beneficial in cases where you want to display multiple lines of text or output in a formatted way. multiline output is used to display the initial message to the user asking them to choose between the investment or bond options. By using multiline output, the message is clearly displayed on multiple lines and is easier to read for the user. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of code can be beneficial and is recommended.



Overall

Excellent submission overall, Jonathan. Keep it up! Overall, the code looks good and accomplishes the task of creating financial calculators for investment and home loan repayment.
